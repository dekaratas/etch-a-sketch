# Etch A Sketch
# Exercise provided by The Odin Project

This exercise revolves around creating a grid of adjustable size that functions similiar to an actual Etch A Sketch.
The individual grid squares are created via JavaScript as opposed to copy-pasting each one into my .html file.
Each individual grid will be colored upon hovering over it.
Additionally, an option exists to switch between various colours including a rainbow option that sequentially changes color over time.

# New skills utilized:
- Incorporating the CSS Grid Layout
- Utilizing new EventListeners such as "Hover"
- Modifying the DOM utilizing (Vanilla) JavaScript as opposed to creating all elements in my .html file
